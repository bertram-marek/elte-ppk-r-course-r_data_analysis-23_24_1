# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.


```{r}
library(readr)

# Define the raw URL of the TSV dataset file from GitHub
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"

# Read the TSV file into a data frame using readr
cocktails <- read_tsv(url)

```


## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Remove all spaces from the ingredients variable
#cocktails$ingredients <- gsub(" ", "", cocktails$ingredients)

# Function to clean and separate ingredients
clean_and_separate_ingredients <- function(ingredient_str) {
  # Remove quantities, units, alcohol content indicators, and special characters
  cleaned_ingredients <- gsub("\\d+\\.?\\d*\\s*(oz|dashes)?|\\d+\\.?\\d*%\\s*(abv)?|\\<br\\/\\>|\\(|\\)|\\/|-", "", ingredient_str)
  
  # Split ingredients into a list, handling line breaks
  #ingredients_list <- unlist(strsplit(cleaned_ingredients, "<br>"))
  
  return(cleaned_ingredients)
}

```

```{r}
# Apply the cleaning and separating function to the dataset
cleaned_data <- cocktails %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(cleaned_ingredients = list(clean_and_separate_ingredients(ingredients))) %>%
  unnest(cleaned_ingredients)

# Remove spaces before and after <br> and <b>
cleaned_data$cleaned_ingredients <- gsub("\\s*(<br>|<b>)\\s*", "\\1", cleaned_data$cleaned_ingredients)


```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Function to clean and separate ingredients
clean_and_separate_ingredients <- function(ingredient_str) {
  
  # Split ingredients into a list, handling line breaks
  ingredients_list <- unlist(strsplit(ingredient_str, "(<br>|<b>)"))
  
  return(ingredients_list)
}
```

```{r}
# Separate and clean ingredients
result <- cleaned_data %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(cleaned_ingredients = list(clean_and_separate_ingredients(cleaned_ingredients))) %>%
  unnest(cleaned_ingredients)

# View the result
View(result)
```



## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.



```{r}
# Extract all ingredients
all_ingredients <- unlist(strsplit(cleaned_data$cleaned_ingredients, "(<br>|<b>)"))

# Remove leading and trailing spaces
all_ingredients <- trimws(all_ingredients)

# Remove duplicates and empty strings
all_ingredients <- unique(na.omit(all_ingredients))

# View the list of ingredients
View(all_ingredients)

```

```{r}
# Create a list of unique ingredients
unique_ingredients <- unique(all_ingredients)

# Print or view the list of unique ingredients
print(unique_ingredients)

# Sort the unique ingredient names alphabetically
unique_ingredients <- sort(unique_ingredients)

# Print the list of all possible ingredients
print(unique_ingredients)

```




## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
# Count the number of unique ingredients
num_unique_ingredients <- length(unique_ingredients)

# Print the number of different ingredients
print(num_unique_ingredients)

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# Remove leading spaces from the 'cleaned_ingredients' column
result$cleaned_ingredients <- sub("^ ", "", result$cleaned_ingredients)

library(dplyr)

# Count the occurrences of each ingredient
ingredient_counts <- result %>%
  group_by(cleaned_ingredients) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Get the top 10 most frequently used ingredients
top_10_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  slice(1:10)

# Print the top 10 most frequently used ingredients
print(top_10_ingredients)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
# Create a new dataframe with only column1 and column2
ingredients <- result[, c("name", "cleaned_ingredients")]

# Count the number of ingredients for each cocktail
ingredient_counts <- ingredients %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(Ingredients = n())

# Find the maximum number of ingredients
max_ingredients <- max(ingredient_counts$Ingredients)

# Filter all cocktails that have the maximum number of ingredients
cocktails_with_max_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(Ingredients == max_ingredients)

# View the cocktails with the most ingredients
print(cocktails_with_max_ingredients)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
#library(dplyr)

# Count how many times each ingredient appears across all cocktails
ingredient_occurrences <- ingredients %>%
  group_by(cleaned_ingredients) %>%
  summarise(Cocktail_Count = n())

# Filter ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
rare_ingredients <- ingredient_occurrences %>%
  filter(Cocktail_Count == 1)

# Count the number of rare ingredients
num_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredients)

# Print the number of rare ingredients
print(num_rare_ingredients)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

# Count how many times each ingredient appears across all cocktails
ingredient_counts <- ingredients %>%
  group_by(cleaned_ingredients) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

# Find ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
unique_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(count == 1)

# Find the cocktails that contain these unique ingredients
unique_cocktails <- ingredients %>%
  filter(cleaned_ingredients %in% unique_ingredients$cleaned_ingredients)

# Get unique cocktail names that have at least one unique ingredient
unique_cocktails_names <- unique(unique_cocktails$name)

# Print the names of cocktails with unique ingredients
print(unique_cocktails_names)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# Find the rare ingredients that only appear once
ingredient_counts <- ingredients %>%
  group_by(cleaned_ingredients) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(count == 1) %>%
  pull(cleaned_ingredients)

# Find the cocktails that do not contain rare ingredients
cocktails_without_rare <- ingredients %>%
  filter(!cleaned_ingredients %in% rare_ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)

# Print the names of cocktails without rare ingredients
print(cocktails_without_rare)

  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Create a contingency table
contingency_table <- xtabs(~ name + cleaned_ingredients, data = ingredients)

# Convert the contingency table to a matrix with "X" and "" for presence/absence
cocktail_matrix <- ifelse(contingency_table > 0, "X", "")

# Convert to a dataframe for a nicer print format in R
cocktail_matrix_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(cocktail_matrix)

# Print the matrix
print(cocktail_matrix_df)

View(cocktail_matrix_df)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
