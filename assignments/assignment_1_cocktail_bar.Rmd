# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}

# Importing data

cocktail_raw <- readr::read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

view(cocktail_raw)


``` 



## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

cocktail <- cocktail_raw %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>") %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>")%>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4>")%>% #for separating cells
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, "\\(([^)]+)\\)")) %>% # removing expressions between parentheses (indicating alcohol content)
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, "(?<=\\d)\\s(?=\\d)")) %>% # removing whitespaces between digits
  mutate(ingredients =  str_remove_all(ingredients, "/"))%>% # removing slashes
  mutate(ingredients =  str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\."))%>% # removing dots
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, "\\d+")) %>% #removing digits
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, "\\b\\w+\\s*")) %>% #removing the first word (oz or drops)
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, "\\d{2,3}-proof")) %>% # removing expressions like 80-proof indicating alcohol content
  mutate(ingredients = trimws(ingredients)) %>% # trimming whitespaces
  mutate(ingredients = tolower(ingredients))  # transforming into lower case


view(cocktail)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

ingredient_list <- cocktail %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = " or ") %>% 
  pull(ingredients) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sort()

view(ingredient_list)
  
  
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

diff_ingredients <- length(ingredient_list)

print(diff_ingredients)


```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

# Sorting the top ten most frequent ingredients

top_ten_cocktail_ingredients <- cocktail %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(desc(n), ingredients)


# Creating a variable with the frequency of the ingredients

freq_numbers <- top_ten_cocktail_ingredients %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  unique() %>% 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE)


# Creating a rank column

top_ten_cocktail_ingredients <- top_ten_cocktail_ingredients %>%
  mutate(rank = match(n, freq_numbers)) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  filter(rank<11)


print(top_ten_cocktail_ingredients)


```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cocktail %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(number_of_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(number_of_ingredients == max(number_of_ingredients)) %>% 
  pull(name) %>% 
  unique()
  

print(cocktails_with_most_ingredients)

  

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

rare_ingredients <- cocktail %>% 
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  mutate(number_of_cocktails = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(number_of_cocktails == 1 ) %>% 
  pull(ingredients)
  
  
print(rare_ingredients)


```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cocktail %>% 
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  mutate(number_of_cocktails = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(number_of_cocktails == 1) %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  unique()


print(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}

cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- cocktail %>% 
  anti_join(data.frame(name = cocktails_with_rare_ingredients)) %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  unique()

print(cocktails_without_rare_ingredients)





```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

# Creating a matrix with cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns

ingredient_matrix <- matrix(nrow = length(unique(cocktail$name)), ncol = length(unique(cocktail$ingredients)),
                        dimnames = list(unique(cocktail$name), unique(cocktail$ingredients)))

# Filling the cells with x-es when an ingredient is needed for a cocktail

for (i in 1:nrow(ingredient_matrix)) {
  cocktail_name <- rownames(ingredient_matrix)[i] # selecting each cocktail name from tha ingredient matrix
  selected_ingredients <- cocktail %>% # selecting the ingredients needed, from the cocktail dataset
    filter(name == cocktail_name) %>%
    select(ingredients) %>%
    unlist()
  selected_columns <- which(colnames(ingredient_matrix) %in% selected_ingredients) # selecting the columns matching the names of the selected ingredients
  ingredient_matrix[i, selected_columns] <- "X" # filling cells of the selected columns in the row of the selected cocktail with X
}


view(ingredient_matrix)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
