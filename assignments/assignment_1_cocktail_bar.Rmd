# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r data, include = FALSE}
library(readr)
coctail_dataset = read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```
```{r}
coctail_dataset
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
coctail_dataset = tidyr::separate_rows(coctail_dataset, "ingredients", sep="<br/>|or\\s") 
coctail_dataset$ingredients<-gsub(".*oz\\s|.*drops\\s|.*dashes\\s|\"|.*dash\\s|.*drop\\s|.*bsp\\s|\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)|.*proof\\s|\\s+$","",coctail_dataset$ingredients)
coctail_dataset$ingredients <- tolower(coctail_dataset$ingredients)
coctail_dataset
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_dup<-sort(coctail_dataset$ingredients)
ingredients_list<- ingredients_dup[!duplicated(ingredients_dup)]
ingredients_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
number_of_ingredient_types = length(unique(ingredients_list))
number_of_ingredient_types

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

sort(table(coctail_dataset$ingredients), decreasing = TRUE)[1:15] 

```

As it can be seen in the table above, top 15 ingredients are lemon juice (14 times), simple syrup (14 times), gin (13 times), angostura bitters (12 times), lime juice (12 times), sweet vermouth (12 times), saline solution (10 times), water (10 times), rye (9 times), cognac (6 times), luxardo maraschino (6 times), bourbon (5 times), clarified lime juice (5 times), cointreau (5 times) and egg white (5 times). 

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
coctail_ingredients = coctail_dataset %>%  
  count(name, ingredients)

grouped_ingredients =coctail_ingredients %>%           
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

sorted_grouped_ingredients = grouped_ingredients %>%  arrange(desc(n))
sorted_grouped_ingredients
```

As it can be seen in the table above, Carbonated Negroni has the most ingredients by having 7 different ingredients. 

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- ingredients_dup[ave(ingredients_dup, ingredients_dup, FUN = length) == 1]
length(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare_coctail_dataset <- filter(coctail_dataset,
                       coctail_dataset$ingredients %in% rare_ingredients)

rare_coctail_names_dup <-rare_coctail_dataset %>% select(name, ingredients)
rare_coctail_names <- rare_coctail_dataset[!duplicated(rare_coctail_names_dup$name), ]
rare_coctail_names %>% select(name)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
not_rare_coctail_dataset<- filter(coctail_dataset,
                       !(coctail_dataset$name %in% rare_coctail_names$name))

not_rare_coctail_names_dup <-not_rare_coctail_dataset %>% select(name)

not_rare_coctail_names <- not_rare_coctail_dataset[!duplicated(not_rare_coctail_names_dup$name), ]
not_rare_coctail_names$name
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
coctails_matrix_dataset <- select(coctail_dataset, name, ingredients)
coctails_matrix_dataset <- coctails_matrix_dataset %>%
    group_by(name, ingredients) %>%
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = ingredients, values_fill = list(ingredients = ""), values_fn = list(ingredients = function(x) "X") 
  )

coctails_matrix_dataset <- subset(coctails_matrix_dataset, select = -c(n))
coctails_matrix_dataset <- coctails_matrix_dataset[, c(1, order(names(coctails_matrix_dataset)[-1]) + 1)]

coctails_matrix_dataset
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
