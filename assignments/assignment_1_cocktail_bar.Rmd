# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
data <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
data_clean <- data %>% 
  separate(col = ingredients, into= c("ing1", "ing2", "ing3", "ing4", "ing5", "ing6"), sep = "<br/>") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("ing1", "ing2", "ing3", "ing4", "ing5", "ing6"), 
               names_to = NULL, values_to = "ingredients", values_drop_na = TRUE) 

patterns_to_remove <- c('(oz )', '(dashes )', '(drops )', '(dash )', 
                        '\\s?\\(\\d+(\\.\\d+)?% abv\\)', 
                        "\\d+\\s?", "\\d+/\\d+\\s?", "\\d+\\.\\d+\\s?",
                        "\\s?/\\s?", "\\.")

data_clean$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data_clean$ingredients, paste(patterns_to_remove, collapse = "|"))
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_list <- as.list(data_clean$ingredients, sorted = TRUE)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
data_clean$ingredients %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  length()
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ingredients_freq <- data_clean$ingredients %>% 
  table() %>% 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE)

frequencies <- ingredients_freq %>% 
  unique("Freq")

top_ingredients <- names(ingredients_freq[ingredients_freq >= frequencies[10]])

print(top_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
most_ingredients <- data_clean %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(num_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_ingredients))

most_coctails <- data_clean %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(num_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  filter(num_ingredients == most_ingredients$num_ingredients[1])

print(most_coctails)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- data_clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n == 1) %>%
  as.list()

length(rare_ingredients$ingredients)

data_clean %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(num_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  filter(num_ingredients == 1) %>% 
  length()
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
data_clean %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients) 
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
data_clean %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  filter(!(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients))  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
unique_names <- unique(data_clean$name)
unique_ingredients <- unique(unlist(data_clean$ingredients))

cheat_sheet <- matrix(0, nrow = length(unique_names), ncol = length(unique_ingredients), 
                     dimnames = list(unique_names, unique_ingredients))


for (i in 1:length(unique_names)) {
  cocktail_name <- unique_names[i]
  ingredients <- unique_ingredients[i]
  cheat_sheet[cocktail_name, ingredients] <- "X"
}

cheat_sheet
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
