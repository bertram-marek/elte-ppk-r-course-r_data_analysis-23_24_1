# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv'
data <- readr::read_tsv(url)
str(data)
head(data)
view(data)

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
tisztitott_adat <- data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("<br>", "<br/>", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients=gsub("<b4>", "<br/>", ingredients)) %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>%
  mutate(
    ingredients = gsub("\\b\\d+\\b|[%/.] |oz|dashes|bsp|drops|\\(|\\)|abv|\\.", "", ingredients),
    ingredients = gsub("[./]", "", ingredients),
    ingredients = gsub("^ +| +$|( ) +", "\\1", ingredients)
  )

view(tisztitott_adat)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredientslist <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(ingredients)

print(ingredientslist, n = nrow(ingredientslist))

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
nrow(ingredientslist)

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top10 <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

print(top10, n=15)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
most_ingredients <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
print(most_ingredients)

selected_data <- select(most_ingredients, name)

print(most_ingredients, n=6)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rareingredient <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  count () %>%
  filter(n==1)

nrow(rareingredient)
print(rareingredient)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare_ingredients_cocktail <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rareingredient$ingredients)

unique_names <- unique(rare_ingredients_cocktail$name)

print(unique_names)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
without_rare <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  filter(!(name %in% unique_names)) %>%
  distinct(name)

print(without_rare, n = nrow(without_rare))
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
unique_ingredients <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  pull(ingredients)

print(unique_ingredients)

unique_cocktail_names <- tisztitott_adat %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  arrange(name) %>%
  pull(name)

print(unique_cocktail_names)

cocktail_matrix <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(unique_cocktail_names), ncol = length(unique_ingredients), dimnames = list(unique_cocktail_names, unique_ingredients))

for (i in 1:nrow(cocktail_matrix)) {
  cocktail <- unique_cocktail_names[i]
  for (j in 1:length(unique_ingredients)) {
    ingredient <- unique_ingredients[j]
    if (any(tisztitott_adat$name == cocktail & tisztitott_adat$ingredients == ingredient)) {
      cocktail_matrix[i, j] <- "X"
    }
  }
}

print(cocktail_matrix)

write.table(cocktail_matrix, "cocktail_matrix.csv", sep="\t", quote=FALSE)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
