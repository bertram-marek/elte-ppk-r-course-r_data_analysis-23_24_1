# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(readr)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"

cocktails <- read_tsv(url)

View(cocktails)

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

# Separate ingredients into different rows
cocktails <- cocktails %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>|<b/>|<br/>|<b>|<b4/>")



# Remove numbers, the space after the numbers, the first word after the space after the numbers
cocktails$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktails$ingredients, "\\b\\d+\\s+\\w+\\b")

# Remove everything within parentheses
cocktails$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktails$ingredients, "\\(.*?\\)")


# Remove '/' and '.' characters
cocktails$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktails$ingredients, "[/\\.]")

# Remove numbers that have a space after them
cocktails$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktails$ingredients, "\\b\\d+\\s\\b")

# Remove leading and trailing whitespaces
cocktails$ingredients <- str_trim(cocktails$ingredients)


View(cocktails)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# Get a list of unique ingredients
unique_ingredients <- unique(cocktails$ingredients)

# Sort the ingredients in alphabetical order
sorted_ingredients <- sort(unique_ingredients)

print(sorted_ingredients)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
# Get the number of unique ingredients
num_unique_ingredients <- length(unique_ingredients)


print(num_unique_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# Count the frequency of each ingredient
ingredient_counts <- table(cocktails$ingredients)

# Sort the frequencies in descending order
sorted_ingredient_counts <- sort(ingredient_counts, decreasing = TRUE)

# Get the top 10 ingredients
top_ingredients <- head(sorted_ingredient_counts, 10)

print(top_ingredients)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

# Group the data by cocktail name and count the number of ingredients in each group
cocktail_counts <- cocktails %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients = n())

# Find the maximum number of ingredients
max_ingredients <- max(cocktail_counts$num_ingredients)

# Filter the cocktails that have the maximum number of ingredients
most_ingredients_cocktails <- cocktail_counts %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredients)

print(most_ingredients_cocktails)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
# Count the number of cocktails each ingredient appears in
ingredient_counts <- cocktails %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(num_cocktails = n())

# Count the number of ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
num_rare_ingredients <- sum(ingredient_counts$num_cocktails == 1)

print(num_rare_ingredients)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
# Get the ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1) %>%
  pull(ingredients)

# Get the cocktails that contain these ingredients
rare_ingredient_cocktails <- cocktails %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients)

# Remove duplicates
rare_ingredient_cocktails <- rare_ingredient_cocktails %>%
  distinct(name, .keep_all = TRUE)


View(rare_ingredient_cocktails)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# Get the cocktails without any rare ingredients directly
common_cocktails_exclusive <- cocktails %>%
  filter(!(name %in% rare_ingredient_cocktails$name))

# Remove duplicates
common_cocktails_exclusive <- common_cocktails_exclusive %>%
  distinct(name, .keep_all = TRUE)

View(common_cocktails_exclusive)
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

cocktails$check <- "X"

# Create the matrix
cocktail_matrix <- cocktails %>%
  group_by(name, ingredients) %>%
  summarise(check = first(check)) %>%
  spread(key = ingredients, value = check, fill = "")

View(cocktail_matrix)
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
