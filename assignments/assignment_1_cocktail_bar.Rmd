# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
data <- read_tsv("data/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Put each ingredient into separate rows
clean_data <- data %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>") %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>")

# Define a function to clean ingredients
clean_ingredients <- function(text) {
  # Remove quantities
  cleaned_text <- str_replace_all(text, "\\b\\d+([/.]\\d+)?\\s*(oz|ml|cl|dashes|drops|abv)?\\b", "")
  
  # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces
  cleaned_text <- str_trim(cleaned_text)
  
  return(cleaned_text)
}

# Apply the cleaning function to the 'ingredients' column
clean_data <- clean_data %>% 
  mutate(cleaned_ingredients = clean_ingredients(clean_data$ingredients))

# Remove alcohol content (% abv) pattern
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(cleaned_ingredients = gsub("\\s*\\(% abv\\)", "", cleaned_ingredients))

# Remove white spaces after ingredients
clean_data <- clean_data %>% 
  mutate(cleaned_ingredients = str_trim(cleaned_ingredients, side = "right"))
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# Create a new data frame for the ingredients' list
ingredients <- clean_data %>% 
  select(cleaned_ingredients)

# Put ingredients into alphabetical order
ingredients <- ingredients %>% 
  mutate(sorted_ingredients = sort(cleaned_ingredients))

# Remove cleaned_ingredients variable
ingredients <- ingredients %>% 
  select(sorted_ingredients)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
ingredients %>% 
  distinct(sorted_ingredients) %>% 
  count(sorted_ingredients) %>% 
  nrow()
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# Count ingredients' frequency
ingredients <- ingredients %>% 
  count(sorted_ingredients)

# Ascending order
ingredients <- ingredients %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# Top 10
tenth_count <- ingredients %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(10) %>%
  pull(n)

top_ingredients <- ingredients %>%
  filter(n >= tenth_count)

print(top_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_ingredients <- clean_data %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# Find the max count of ingredients
max_ingredients <- max(cocktail_ingredients$n)

# Filter to select cocktails with the maximum count of ingredients
rich_cocktails <- cocktail_ingredients %>%
  filter(n == max_ingredients)

print(rich_cocktails)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- ingredients %>% 
  filter(n == 1) %>% 
  select(sorted_ingredients)

count(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
print(rare_ingredients)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# Find non-rare ingredients (remove rare ones)
non_rare_ingredients <- ingredients %>% 
  filter(n != 1)

# Find cocktails that do not contain rare ingredients
non_rare_cocktails <- clean_data[clean_data$cleaned_ingredients %in% non_rare_ingredients$sorted_ingredients, ] %>% 
  select(name, cleaned_ingredients)

# List of cocktails that do not contain any rare ingredient
non_rare_cocktails %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  print()
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))

# Create data frame
cheatsheet <- clean_data %>%
  select(name, cleaned_ingredients) %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(present = "X") %>% # Binary indicator of the presence of each ingredient in each cocktail
  pivot_wider(names_from = cleaned_ingredients, values_from = present, values_fill = "") # Transform

# Display the resulting matrix
print(cheatsheet)
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
