# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(stringr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail.data.raw <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r cocktail-data-clean}
cocktail.cleaner <- 
  function(ingredients) {
  cocktail.cleaner <-
    gsub("\\d+\\/\\d+\\s*oz|\\d+\\s*oz|\\(\\d+\\.?\\d*%\\s*abv\\)|\\d+|\\.|\\s+", "",ingredients)
  cocktail.cleaner <- 
    trimws(cocktail.cleaner)
    return(cocktail.cleaner)
}

cocktail.data.clean <- 
  cocktail.data.raw %>%
  mutate(ingredients = cocktail.cleaner(ingredients)) %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<b/>|<br>") %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) %>%
  filter(ingredients != "")
cocktail.data.clean %>% glimpse
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r ingredients-sort}
ingredients.sort <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(ingredients) %>%
  filter(!duplicated(ingredients))
kable(ingredients.sort)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r n-ingredients}
n.ingredients <- 
  nrow(ingredients.sort)

```
Numer of unique ingredients: `r n.ingredients`

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r top-10}
top.10 <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n)
kable(top.10)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r cocktail-ingredient-n}
cocktail.ingredient.n <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(ingredient.n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(ingredient.n)) %>%
  slice_max(ingredient.n)
kable(cocktail.ingredient.n)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r rare-ingredient}

rare.ingredients <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(cocktail.count = n()) %>%
  filter(cocktail.count == 1)
kable(rare.ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r cocktail-rare}
cocktail.rare <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare.ingredients$ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)
kable(cocktail.rare)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r cocktail-common}
cocktail.common <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(has.rare.ingredients = sum(ingredients %in% rare.ingredients$ingredients) > 0) %>%
  filter(!has.rare.ingredients)
kable(cocktail.common)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))

```

```{r cocktail-cheatsheet}

cocktail.cheatsheet <- 
  cocktail.data.clean %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients) %>%
  mutate(value = "X") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = value, values_fill = "")
kable(cocktail.cheatsheet)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
