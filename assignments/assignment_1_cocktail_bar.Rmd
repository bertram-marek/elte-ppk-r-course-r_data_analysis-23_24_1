# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
data <- read.delim(file = 'cocktail_data.tsv')
view(data)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "oz")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "bsp")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "dashes")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "dash")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "drops")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "drop")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "% abv")
data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(data$ingredients, "/")
data$ingredients <- gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", data$ingredients)
ing <- data %>% 
  mutate(ingredients = strsplit(as.character(ingredients), "<br>")) %>% 
  unnest(ingredients) 
view(ing)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

ing$ingredients <- str_replace_all(ing$ingredients, "[^[:alnum:]]", " ")
ingabc <- ing[order(ing$ingredients),]
ingabc$ingredients <- trimws(ingabc$ingredients)
view(ingabc)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need? (62)

```{r}
length(unique(ingabc$ingredients))
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
freq <- table(ingabc$ingredients)
sorted <- freq[order(freq,decreasing = TRUE)] 
common <- sorted[1:10]
common
sorted
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
databc <- ingabc[order(ingabc$name),]
view(databc)
freq2 <- table(databc$name)
sorted2 <- freq2[order(freq2,decreasing = TRUE)]
sorted2
df<-as.data.frame(sorted2)
df
two <- df %>%
  filter(Freq==2)
two
three <- df %>%
  filter(Freq==3)
three
four <- df %>%
  filter(Freq==4)
four
five <- df %>%
  filter(Freq==5)
five
six <- df %>%
  filter(Freq==6)
six
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
df2 <-as.data.frame(sorted)
df2
rare <- df2 %>%
  filter(Freq==1)
rare
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rarity <- (rare$Var1)
rarity
rr <- c(rarity)
rr
only <- databc[match(rr, databc$ingredients), ]
view(only)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
non <- df2 %>%
  filter(Freq!=1)
non
nonrar <- (non$Var1)
nonrar
nr <- c(nonrar)
nr
without <- databc[match(nr, databc$ingredients), ]
view(without)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cs <- unique(databc$name)
cs
csv <- c(cs)
csv
ins <- unique(databc$ingredients)
ins
inv <- c(ins)
inv
cheat <- matrix(c(1:3410),nrow=55,ncol=62,byrow=TRUE)
rownames(cheat)=csv
colnames(cheat)=inv
print(cheat)
dfcheat=as.data.frame(cheat)
dfcheat
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
