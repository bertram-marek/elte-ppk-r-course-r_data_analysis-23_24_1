## General information

This is a guide that explains how you should submit your assignments.
Please read it before you start working on your assignments, this way
you can save a lot of time for yourself. If you have any more question
after reading this guide please write Bertram Marek (teacher assistant)
at <marek.bertram@ppk.elte.hu>.

**Note: You only have to finish two assignments of your choosing. You do
not have to do all of them.**

## How to submit the assignemnts

Submitting the assignments will require the use of Git and Github. There
is a detailed tutorial on how to use Git with R that you can find here:

-   Work on each assignment in the .Rmd files in the “assignment/”
    folder on your computer.

-   Push the changes to your forked project. (Also do this frequently,
    e.g. after each assignment).

    as reviewers

**Have Fun!**
